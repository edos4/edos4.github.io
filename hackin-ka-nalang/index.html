						<h3>Kevin Mitnick: From schoolboy hacker to FBI's most wanted</h3>

							Press arrow down. ;)

					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							In highschool, Mitnick was asked to write a program to find the first 100 Fibonacci numbers as an assignment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Instead of doing the homework, he created a fake login screen to steal his teacher's password.
						</p>
						<p>
							When homework was due, he just said, "I got a better one. Isn't your password 'johnco'?". 
						</p>
						<p>
							Mitnick said, "He was really impressed and he shared it with all the class, so that was the ethics that were taught to me as a kid, that it was cool to hack."
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
						At age 13, he used social engineering and asked the bus driver where to buy a ticket punch for "a school project". Then, he did dumpster diving and used unused transfer slips he found in a dumpster next to the bus company garage. After that, he could ride any bus in the greater LA area
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							As a teenager, he took control of a McDonald's drive-through ordering system just to watch the surprise of the McDonald's employees.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
						After his first experience writing a computer program, Mitnick says he became "the guy who pushed the envelope"(extends the limits of what is possible), but he never saw himself as malicious. Rather, he believes he was mischievous, hacking into companies not to steal their data, but for the challenge.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							However, throughout the 1980s and '90s things got serious and Mitnick became notorious in law enforcement circles.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							He penetrated the systems of more than 40 corporations, including Nokia, Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment Corporation, Motorola, and Netcom.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even in the closing stages of the legal pursuit, he says he was still having fun. Realising the FBI was onto him he wire tapped the agents on his case, setting up a warning system to alert him when a call was placed to the officers near his office. 
						</p>
						<p>
							In a middle finger to the FBI, Mitnick cleared out his equipment and left a box of donuts waiting for them.
						</p>
						<p>
							It all came to an end in 1995 when he was arrested on numerous charges including wire fraud and he served five years in prison.
						</p>
