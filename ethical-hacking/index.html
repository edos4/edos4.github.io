							Press arrow down. ;)
						</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							In highschool, Mitnick was asked to write a program to find the first 100 Fibonacci numbers as an assignment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Instead of doing the homework, he created a fake login screen to steal his teacher's password.
						</p>
						<p>
							When homework was due, he just said, "I got a better one. Isn't your password 'johnco'?". 
						</p>
						<p>
							Mitnick said, "He was really impressed and he shared it with all the class, so that was the ethics that were taught to me as a kid, that it was cool to hack."
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
						At age 13, he used social engineering and asked the bus driver where to buy a ticket punch for "a school project". Then, he did dumpster diving and used unused transfer slips he found in a dumpster next to the bus company garage. After that, he could ride any bus in the greater LA area
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							As a teenager, he took control of a McDonald's drive-through ordering system just to watch the surprise of the McDonald's employees.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
						After his first experience writing a computer program, Mitnick says he became "the guy who pushed the envelope"(extends the limits of what is possible), but he never saw himself as malicious. Rather, he believes he was mischievous, hacking into companies not to steal their data, but for the challenge.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							However, throughout the 1980s and '90s things got serious and Mitnick became notorious in law enforcement circles.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							He penetrated the systems of more than 40 corporations, including Nokia, Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment Corporation, Motorola, and Netcom.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even in the closing stages of the legal pursuit, he says he was still having fun. Realising the FBI was onto him he wire tapped the agents on his case, setting up a warning system to alert him when a call was placed to the officers near his office. 
						</p>
						<p>
							In a middle finger to the FBI, Mitnick cleared out his equipment and left a box of donuts waiting for them.
						</p>
						<p>
							It all came to an end in 1995 when he was arrested on numerous charges including wire fraud and he served five years in prison.
						</p>

						<h3>Attacker's Kill Chain</h3>
						<p>
							Kill chains are metamodels of an attacker's behavior when they attempt to compromise a network or a particular data system. They are steps taken by an adversary when they are attacking a network. 
						</p>
						<p>
							It does not always proceed in a linear flow as some steps may occur in parallel. Multiple attacks may be launched over time at the same target, and overlapping stages may occur at the same time.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Typical Kill Chain</h3>
						<img src="img/killchain.png" />
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>
							Reconnaissance Phase
						</h2>
						<p>
							"Reconnaissance time is never wasted time." Military organizations find that it is better to know about the enemy before engaging them. Attackers will also conduct extensive reconnaissance of a target before attacking.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is estimated that at least 70 percent of the "work effort" of a penetration test or an attack is spent conducting reconnaissance! 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							Two Types of Reconnaissance
						</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Active Reconnaissance
							</li>
							<li>
								Passive Reconnaissance
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							Passive Reconnaissance
						</h4>
						<p>
							Analyzing information that is openly available, usually from the target itself or public sources online. The tester or attacker does not interact with the target and activities will not be logged, or will not be traced directly to the tester. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Passive reconnaissance is conducted first to minimize detection.
						</p>
						<img src="img/recon1.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							First Step: Gather Open Source intelligence
						</h4>
						<p>
							OSINT is information collected from public sources, particularly the Internet. Most intelligence and military organizations are actively engaged in OSINT activities to collect information about their targets, and to guard against data leakage about them.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							Lifehack
						</h4>
						<p>
							The US Army manual ATP 2-22.9 (http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/atp2-22-9.pdf) and the NATO OSINT manual (http://information-retrieval.info/docs/NATO-OSINT.html) are both available online, and provide excellent technical reviews of how to gather and assess OSINT.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							OSINT Gathering
						</h4>
						<p>
							Usually starts with a review of the target's official online presence (website, blogs, social-media pages, and third-party data repositories such as public financial records). Information of interest includes the following:
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							OSINT Gathering
						</h4>
						<li>
							Geographical locations of offices, especially remote or satellite offices that share corporate information but may lack stringent security controls.
						</li>
						<li>
							Overview of the parent company and any subsidiary companies, especially any new companies acquired by mergers or acquisitions(these companies are frequently not as secure as the parent company).
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							OSINT Gathering
						</h4>
						<li>
							Employee names and contact information, especially names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers.
						</li>
						<li>
							Clues about the corporate culture and language; this will facilitate social engineering attacks.
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							OSINT Gathering
						</h4>
						<li>
							Business partners or vendors that may connect into the target's network.
						</li>
						<li>
							Technologies in use. For example, if the target issues a press release about adopting new devices or software, the attacker will review the vendor's website for bug reports, known or suspected vulnerabilities, and details that could be used to facilitate various attacks.
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							OSINT Gathering
						</h4>
						<li>
							Search engines such as Google and Bing. The attacker enters search terms that are specific for information of interest; for example, the search term "company name" + password filetype:xls may  contain employee passwords. These search terms are referred to as google dorks ( www.exploit-db.com/google-dorks/ ). 
						</li>
						<p>
							You're welcome. ;p
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							OSINT Gathering
						</h4>
						<li>
							LinkedIn, Jigsaw, and other websites that provide employee information
						</li>
						<li>
							Corporate and employee blogs, as well as personal blogs of key employees. Example, google "Edwin Richbald A. Salinas"
						</li>
						<li>
							Password dumpsites (pastebin, search using site:pastebin.com "linkedin" ) 
							<small>P.S. Change password if you find your password there :p</small>
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							DNS reconnaissance and route mapping
						</h4>
						<p>
							Once a tester has identified the targets having an online presence and contain items of interest, the next step is to identify the IP addresses and routes to the target.
						</p>
						<li>
							DNS reconnaissance is concerned with identifying who owns a particular domain or series of IP addresses ( whois -type information), the DNS information defining the actual domain names and IP addresses assigned to the target, and the route between the penetration tester or the attacker and the final target.
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							WHOIS
						</h4>
						<p>
							The first step in researching the IP address space is to identify the addresses that are assigned to the target site. This is usually accomplished by using the whois command, which queries databases that store information on the registered users of an Internet resource, such as a domain name or IP address.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							WHOIS Info Can Be Used To
						</h4>
						<li>
							Support a social engineering attack against the location or persons identified in the query
						</li>
						<li>
							Identify a location for a physical attack
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							WHOIS Info Can Be Used To
						</h4>
						<li>
							Identify phone numbers that can be used for a war dialing attack, or to conduct a social engineering attack
						</li>
						<li>
							Conduct recursive searches to locate other domains hosted on the same server as the target or operated by the same user; if they are insecure, an attacker can exploit them to gain administrative access to the server, and then compromise the target server
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>
							Mapping the Route to the Target
						</h4>
						<p>
							From an attacker's, or penetration tester's perspective, the traceroute data yields the following important data: 
						</p>
						<li>
							The exact path between the attacker and the target
						</li>
						<li>
							Hints pertaining to the network's external topology
						</li>
						<li>
							Identification of accessing control devices (firewalls and packet-filtering routers) that may be filtering attack traffic
						</li>
						<li>
							If the network is misconfigured, it may be possible to identify internal addressing
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Kali provides the following tools for tracing routes:

						<h3>
							Gathering names and e-mail addresses
						</h3>
						<p>
							The theharvester tool is a Python script that searches through popular search engines and other sites for e-mail addresses, hosts, and subdomains.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Gathering names and e-mail addresses
						</h3>
						<p>
							Using theharvester is relatively simple as there are only a few command switches to set. The options available are:
						</p>
						<li>
							-d : Identifies the domain to be searched; usually the domain or target's website.
						</li>
						<li>
	 						-b : Identifies the source for extracting the data; it must be one of the following: Bing, Google, or All
						</li>
						<li>
							-l : This limit option instructs theharvester to only harvest data from a specified number of returned search results.
						</li>
						<li>
							-f : This option is used to save the final results to an HTML and an XML file. 
						</li>

						<h3>
							Profiling users for password lists
						</h3>
						<p>
							Common User Password Profiler (CUPP) allows the tester to generate a wordlist that is specific to a particular user. CUPP was present on Backtrack 5r3; however, it will have to be downloaded for use on Kali. To obtain CUPP, enter the following command:
						</p>
						git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git

						<p>
							The Social Engineering Framework is a searchable information resource for people wishing to learn more about the psychological, physical and historical aspects of social engineering.

						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Summary
						</h3>
						<li>
							The first real step in the attack process or kill chain is to conduct reconnaissance to identify the target and potential attack routes. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Passive reconnaissance assesses data that is publicly available. This is a stealthy assessment—the IP address or activities of the attacker are almost indistinguishable from normal access. Nevertheless, this information can be critical when conducting social engineering attacks, or facilitating other attack types.
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Summary
						</h3>
						<li>
							No matter how technologically-secure a system is, humans are still the weakest link.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you are a malicious hacker, you could hack a company just by reconnaissance and social engineering. You would not even need a computer.
						</li>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Active Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Scanning
						</h3>
						<p>
							Active reconnaissance builds on the results of OSINT and passive reconnaissance, and focuses on using probes to identify the path to the target and the exposed attack surface of the target.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Active Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Scanning
						</h3>
						<p>
							Although active reconnaissance produces more useful information, interactions with the target system may be logged, triggering alarms such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Live host discovery
						</h3>
						<p>
							The first step is to run network ping sweeps against a target address space and look for responses that indicate that a particular target is live and capable of responding. Historically, pinging referred to the use of ICMP; however, TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP traffic can also be used to identify live hosts.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Live host discovery
						</h3>
						<p>
							Scanners available in Kali: 
						</p>
						<img src="img/kali-scanner.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Live host discovery: ProTip
						</h3>
						<p>
							Run multiple host discovery scans while conducting a penetration test. Certain devices may be time dependent. During one penetration test, it was discovered that the system administrator set up a game server after regular business hours. Because it was not an approved business system, multiple vulnerable services were present, and it had not received necessary security patches. Testers were able to compromise the game server and gain access to the underlying corporate network using vulnerabilities in the administrator's game server. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Port Scanning
						</h3>
						<p>
							The process of connecting to TCP and UDP ports to determine what services and applications are running on the target device. Sample NMAP run:
						</p>
						<img src="img/nmap.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Summary
						</h3>
						<p>
							During active reconnaissance, the attackers face a very real chance of their activities being identified, putting them at risk. This must be balanced against the need to map a network, find open ports, and determine the operating system and applications that are installed.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Summary
						</h3>
						<p>
							To reduce risks, attackers must adopt stealthy scanning techniques. Manual approaches are used to create slow scans; however, this approach is not always effective. Therefore, attackers take advantage of tools such as the Tor network and various proxying applications to hide their identity.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Exploit. Hehe.
						</h3>
						<p>
							Penetration testers and attackers must find the particular exploits that will compromise known and suspected vulnerabilities. The first place to start the search is at vendor sites; most hardware and application vendors release information about vulnerabilities when they release patches and upgrades.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							Exploit. Hehe.
						</h3>
						<p>
							Other online sites that collect, analyze, and share information about vulnerabilities are as follows:
						</p>
						<li>
							Packetstorm security available at http://packetstormsecurity.com/
						</li>
						<li>
							SecurityFocus available at http://www.securityfocus.com/vulnerabilities
						</li>
						<li>
							Inj3ct0r available at http://1337day.com/

							The Exploit Database maintained by Offensive Security available at http://www.db-exploit.com
						</li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							The Metasploit Framework
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an open source tool designed to facilitate penetration testing. It uses a modular approach to facilitating exploits. This makes it easier to develop and code exploits, and it also allows for complex attacks to be easily implemented.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							The Metasploit Framework
						</h3>
						<p>
							The steps for exploiting a target system using MSF can be summarized as follows:
						</p>
						<p>
							<li>Choose and configure an exploit (the code that compromises a specific vulnerability on the target system).</li> 
							<li>Check the target system to determine if it is susceptible to attack by the exploit.</li>
							<li>Choose and configure the payload (the code that will be executed on the target system following a successful exploitation.).</li>
							<li>Choose an encoding technique to bypass detection controls (IDs/IPs or antivirus software). 
							<li>Execute the exploit.</li>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							The Metasploit Framework
						</h3>
						<p>
							Example: exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability that was identified in Chasys Draw IES (Version 4.10.01). The vulnerability exists in the ReadFile function, which is used to store user-provided data in an insecure way.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							The Metasploit Framework
						</h3>
						<p>
							To initiate the attack, the tester needs to generate a specially crafted BMP file and then get the victim to open that file in the Chasys application. When this occurs, it will compromise the base operating system (effective against Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							The Metasploit Framework
						</h3>
						<p>
							When the exploit is completed, it creates the specially-crafted BMP file, which is stored with the default name of msf.bmp . To entice the target to open the file and avoid a default name that may be detected by some devices, it is best to change the filename to something that is more relevant to the intended target.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							The Metasploit Framework
						</h3>
						<p>
							The next step is to open a new instance of msfconsole , and set up a listener for the incoming reverse TCP shell that will originate from the target when it is compromised. A simple listener is shown in the following screenshot:
						</p>
						<img src="img/msf1.png" />
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>
							The Metasploit Framework
						</h3>
						<p>
							Once the victim opens the crafted BMP image file in the vulnerable application, a meterpreter session is opened between the two systems. The msf prompt is replaced by the meterpreter prompt and the tester can effectively access the remote system with a command shell.
						</p>
